The chicken lasagna was cheesy and very tasty. The naanza which is a modification of a pizza with a naan base was a refreshing change and good too. The best dish of all was the chimney cake. Had taken the brownie fudge and it was great.

Beautiful decor and well lit.They bring to Hyderabad the concept of Chimney cones were you can enjoy a hot fill or a cold fill in a freshly baked chimney. They do have regular burgers, pizza, sandwiches on their menu too.We ordered for a chicken sandwich, cappuccino and a cold fill peanut butter chimney cone.Sandwich and coffee were good but the chimney cone is something that I thought looked better then how it tasted. It was a straight up thick cone layered with peanut butter filled with vanilla ice cream. The chimney cones are way too thick and has a hole in the bottom making it really inconvenient and messy to eat.Overall a good place to hangout and give the chimney cones a try and see if you like it, the service was good and the staff friendly.cooktravelrepeat.com"

The spread was excellent, far too many dishes for one man to taste. I loved the roast chicken, pork stew & the steak & eggs. Cold cuts were also good, but choice was limited. Pizza & sushi were kind of a letdown though. The live grill was quite good, though the chef over cooked the marinated tenderloins (partly my fault, since I forgot to tell him to cook it medium rare, but then again a professional chef should by default not cook steak above medium readiness). Desserts were good, but I felt they need to diversify their dessert spread, which was too focussed on multi-tier cakes. As for the drinks, I enjoyed the Whiskey Sour. Overall I felt that while the large spread is commendable, more care needs to be taken to perfect each offering."

Pizza was perfect with a thin and crispy base.Noodles was served with assorted vegetables in chilly garlic sauce, and it was simply lip smacking!!!Finally, the only thing I wasn't satisfied with is their value for money. Found it a bit over pricey. Otherwise, it's a been a good experience.My Suggestion: Worth a try!"

Had their white rabbit beer which was light and a bit on the sweeter side. I liked it.We also tried tequila with lemon, kamikaze shot, broadway mule they also were quite good. For sides we had fish fingers, chicken popcorn, prawns and Quesadilla and also chicken kebabs.All these tasted too good.This is the only microbrewery which serves the best food along with best beers.

While their night life is quite popular, I personally highly recommend the place for brunch.Great view of the locale, piping hot dishes and chilled liquor and some great cocktails. You have to go here.Personal kitchen favourites are :-Ghee Roast mushroom: What a fusion of flavours! Mushrooms stir fried in butter and a lot of Indian spices served on a Malabar parota. This one is a clear winner. The combination is very promising.-Malaysian Potato curry and Roti Canai-Big eat favorite, right here. The helping is generous and the lingering flavour of lemon grass and coconut milk is amazing . The potatoes are well fried and flavoured. The roti Canai, ironic resemblance to a malabar parota is buttery and flaky and almost melt in the mouth.Definitely coming back for more lunches."

The food taste is quite ok but the service is what makes it special. Though that service will make a very very big hole in your pocket. The place is too costly when compared to its peers or competitions. An advice : Go to this place only on weekends and that too when you can shelve extra amount. Half of the drinks are not available there. Rest the place though has capability to make an evening.

My favourite from the menu is the vegetarian version of Keema parantha. Personally speaking, for my appetite, one stuffed parantha is enough. The parantha itself is a regular tawa parantha, filled with Tofu Keema, cut into 4 pieces. You bite into it, and you get a spicy flavour, but one that doesn't leave a chilli after taste. It came with green chutney, and the packing is quite immaculate.It also comes with a small portion of the Super Food of the Day. With today's order, I received a small Til Ladoo (Sesame Sweet).I wish they used lesser plastic for the packaging, though. For 73 bucks (post discount), this is one pocket-friendly and satiating dish."

Diavola pizza (tomato sauce, mozzarella, spicy salami and black olives) was truly the most incredible combination we have had in a while. Their risotto too was amazing, rich and thick like a risotto should be (the only flaw was the fact that they thought we had ordered for seafood risotto but we had actually ordered for the wild mushroom one. So in a hurry to prepare for it, the rice were a bit uncooked). We truly enjoyed the authentic flavours of Italian food and also their Tiramisu is a must must have.

What I really liked about the place was that the staff gives you space, unlike others where they are nosey and pushing you to give order. The issue what i faced was with the lights. Lights is a major thing that creates the ambience. It probably created the mood but not bright enough for me to be able to read the menu. Also, I way the menu card was designed, did not impress me.

To be honest, I was let down. Draught beer on the menu was not available. Which makes you choose from other list where KF was again not available. To me this feels like strategies around new year to make customers buy into different costly products. Apart from drink we ordered burger and a pizza. Burger was small with a tiny salad serving and countable french fries. I am not a fan of slippery slope burger. It didnt match up to its name - hot and spicy. It was plain cheese (with very slight tinge of cheddar) and chicken patty that was neither hot or spicy. For the price, not worth it. Similarly, the pizza was with no trace of cheddar, and very thinly sliced mushroom toppings. So thin that i can safely assume it was one mushroom for thr entire pizza.Ambience did not appeal to me to the name. However I liked the music being played.

It looks like a bungalow turned to a cafe sort of a place, but it has good amount of space and perfect atmosphere.Food looked promising and did do justice to the order.Although, I have not yet tried the bar menu, looking forward to visit the place on a weekend night to see if the place is actually worth the hype!I had ordered the Veggie Cheese Baked Nachos which were not satisfactory as they just looked like some packed tortilla chips with some cheese topped on them. The dish when served looked very promising but did not meet the expectations."

But it's energy and buzz never ceases to amaze me.It was a busy weekend afternoon the day I visited. We could not get a table that was closer to the ground. We were stuck with high table that were quite uncomfortable for us. However we still managed to eat are food and drink there.My friend ordered a stuffed roasted chicken with jus on the side accompanied by a detox juice which had mixed fruit and veggies. I had a creamy chicken ravioli in white sauce accompanied by a pina colada. We thoroughly enjoyed are food and drinks.The detox juice did not seem to be fresh and tasted artificial.Overall a must visit while you are in Hyderabad for sure. The best time to visit is in the evening or afternoon during the weekdays as it gets crowded on the weekends.

The brews are a 6/10. Maybe this is because if you compare with their Bangalore peers they kinda fall short against places like Toit and Arbor !!

One of the acclaimed breweries with a wide range of food and alcohol options, this is a perfect place to chill with its rustic interiors, amazing drink menu, and myriad of options for the food.We ordered the beer taster, which I think would be a good start to begin understanding the different options they offer. At a nominal price of 200 it sets the tone for the orders to come without disappointment. And the jalape√±o cheese balls were a perfect addition to the table. Further we ordered the chilly baby corn that wasn‚Äôt much appreciated but you could try other options. Since we went late and their kitchen was closed, we ordered falafel and pita bread that was light and just fine. The icing on the cake was the molecular signature cocktail with a tinge of spices and whiskey. A strong one but a good try.Overall, I would recommend this place for a party night much more than for a lunch."
