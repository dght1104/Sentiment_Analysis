They do have regular burgers, pizza, sandwiches on their menu too.We ordered for a chicken sandwich, cappuccino and a cold fill peanut butter chimney cone.Sandwich and coffee were good but the chimney cone is something that I thought looked better then how it tasted. It was a straight up thick cone layered with peanut butter filled with vanilla ice cream. The chimney cones are way too thick and has a hole in the bottom making it really inconvenient and messy to eat.Overall a good place to hangout and give the chimney cones a try and see if you like it, the service was good and the staff friendly.cooktravelrepeat.com",Positive

The spread was excellent, far too many dishes for one man to taste. I loved the roast chicken, pork stew & the steak & eggs. Cold cuts were also good, but choice was limited. Pizza & sushi were kind of a letdown though. The live grill was quite good, though the chef over cooked the marinated tenderloins (partly my fault, since I forgot to tell him to cook it medium rare, but then again a professional chef should by default not cook steak above medium readiness). Desserts were good, but I felt they need to diversify their dessert spread, which was too focussed on multi-tier cakes. As for the drinks, I enjoyed the Whiskey Sour.

Well, it seemed like a nice place till we actually got there. We were not even allowed inside because apparently they have a very strict dress code. All of us were in semi formals as we went to the place straight from the work — so we were not exactly inappropriately dressed. The only thing missing were shoes. Some of us were wearing flip flops. We were asked to leave as we were not wearing shoes - or at least that is what we were told. Seems like people are being judged by their footwear there days! It’s a brewery — people go there to chill out. I found this behaviour to be highly unprofessional and downright insulting.Rest assured, I’ll not visit this place, nor will I ever recommend it to anyone.Recommendation: A strict NO!",Positive

To be honest, I was let down. Draught beer on the menu was not available. Which makes you choose from other list where KF was again not available. To me this feels like strategies around new year to make customers buy into different costly products. Apart from drink we ordered burger and a pizza. Burger was small with a tiny salad serving and countable french fries. I am not a fan of slippery slope burger. It didnt match up to its name - hot and spicy. It was plain cheese (with very slight tinge of cheddar) and chicken patty that was neither hot or spicy. For the price, not worth it. Similarly, the pizza was with no trace of cheddar, and very thinly sliced mushroom toppings. So thin that i can safely assume it was one mushroom for thr entire pizza.Ambience did not appeal to me to the name. However I liked the music being played. Umm, if you ask me if I would like to return, nah. Did not find value to the buck spent.",Positive
